<!-- Hi, In this video, we will encode and decode base64 in pure JavaScript. It is an important topic in web development to convert any file to base64. This can prevent your file direct URL from being used by anyone and hence save your hosting bandwidth. All the process is well explained in the video, and after watching this, you can do base64 conversions easily with vanilla JS.
